# The American Civil War: Causes, Conduct, and Consequences

## Background and Tensions

**Economic Divergence**

The North and South developed fundamentally different economic systems by the 1850s. Northern states embraced industrial manufacturing, urbanization, and wage labor. Southern states remained predominantly agricultural, dependent on plantation slavery for cotton, tobacco, and rice production.

This economic divergence created conflicting interests regarding federal policy. Northern industrialists favored protective tariffs to shield domestic manufacturing from foreign competition. Southern planters opposed tariffs that increased costs of imported goods while providing no benefit to agricultural exports.

**Missouri Compromise**

The Missouri Compromise of 1820 temporarily resolved tensions over slavery expansion. Missouri entered as a slave state, Maine as free. The 36Â°30' parallel divided future territories.

**Compromise of 1850**

California admitted as free state. Utah and New Mexico territories organized without slavery restrictions. Fugitive Slave Act strengthened. Slave trade abolished in Washington D.C.

**Kansas-Nebraska Act (1854)**

Stephen Douglas proposed popular sovereignty for Kansas and Nebraska territories. This effectively repealed the Missouri Compromise. "Bleeding Kansas" resulted from pro and anti-slavery settlers' conflicts.

## Political Breakdown

**Republican Party Formation**

The Republican Party emerged in 1854 as an anti-slavery expansion coalition. Former Whigs, Free Soilers, and some Democrats joined. Abraham Lincoln became the party's standard bearer by 1860.

**Election of 1860**

Lincoln won with 39.8% of popular vote but majority of electoral votes. Southern states viewed Republican victory as existential threat. Seven states seceded before Lincoln's inauguration.

## Secession Crisis

**Confederate Formation**

South Carolina seceded December 20, 1860. Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas followed by February 1861. Confederate States of America formed with Jefferson Davis as president.

**Fort Sumter**

Lincoln faced dilemma of federal property in Confederate territory. Attempted resupply of Fort Sumter prompted Confederate attack April 12, 1861. War began with this first engagement.

## Military Leadership

**Union Commanders**

**Winfield Scott:** Aging general-in-chief proposed Anaconda Plan to blockade South and control Mississippi River.

**George McClellan:** Organized Army of the Potomac but criticized for excessive caution and political ambitions.

**Ulysses S. Grant:** Rose from obscurity through western victories. Appointed general-in-chief 1864. Pursued relentless campaign strategy.

**William T. Sherman:** Grant's trusted subordinate. Conducted devastating march through Georgia and Carolinas.

**Confederate Commanders**

**Robert E. Lee:** Virginia's most respected military leader. Reluctantly joined Confederacy. Commanded Army of Northern Virginia with tactical brilliance.

**Stonewall Jackson:** Lee's most effective subordinate until death at Chancellorsville 1863. Known for rapid marches and aggressive attacks.

**James Longstreet:** Lee's senior corps commander. Advocated defensive tactics. Later criticized for Gettysburg performance.

## Major Battles and Campaigns

**First Bull Run (1861)**
Union overconfidence met Confederate determination. McDowell's advance on Richmond failed. Demonstrated war would be prolonged conflict.

**Peninsula Campaign (1862)**
McClellan's cautious approach to Richmond allowed Lee to launch Seven Days' Battles. Union forces withdrew despite tactical advantages.

**Antietam (1862)**
Lee's first invasion of North ended at Sharpsburg. McClellan had copy of Lee's plans but failed to destroy Confederate army. Bloodiest single day in American history.

**Gettysburg (1863)**
Lee's second northern invasion culminated in three-day battle. Pickett's Charge on July 3 failed decisively. Confederate high-water mark of the war.

**Vicksburg Campaign (1863)**
Grant's brilliant maneuvering isolated Confederate fortress. Siege lasted 47 days. Mississippi River under Union control.

**Overland Campaign (1864)**
Grant's spring offensive against Lee featured battles at Wilderness, Spotsylvania, and Cold Harbor. Heavy casualties but relentless pressure on Confederates.

**Atlanta Campaign (1864)**
Sherman's advance against Joseph Johnston, later John Bell Hood. Fall of Atlanta helped ensure Lincoln's reelection. Beginning of Sherman's destructive warfare.

**March to the Sea (1864)**
Sherman's march from Atlanta to Savannah demonstrated Union ability to destroy Confederate infrastructure. Total war brought conflict to civilian population.

## Home Front Experiences

**Union Mobilization**

Federal government expanded powers dramatically. National banking system created. Transcontinental railroad construction continued. Immigration encouraged to fill labor shortages.

Draft riots in New York City (1863) revealed class tensions. Wealthy could pay $300 commutation fee. Irish immigrants particularly opposed military service.

**Confederate Challenges**

Southern economy collapsed under wartime pressures. Inflation reached catastrophic levels. Food shortages became widespread by 1863. Impressment of supplies alienated farmers.

Southern women took unprecedented economic roles. Managed plantations and businesses. Organized relief societies. Some participated in bread riots.

## Emancipation and African Americans

**Emancipation Proclamation**

Lincoln issued preliminary proclamation September 1862. Final version January 1, 1863. Freed slaves in rebellious states only. Political and military measure.

**African American Military Service**

54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment demonstrated black soldiers' valor. 180,000 African Americans served in Union forces. Decisive factor in Union victory.

**Contraband Camps**

Escaped slaves gathered around Union armies. Military commanders varied in policies toward refugees. Camps provided freedom but often poor conditions.

## Diplomacy and International Relations

**European Neutrality**

Britain and France considered Confederate recognition. Trent Affair nearly brought British intervention. Emancipation Proclamation reduced European sympathy for Confederacy.

**Confederate Diplomacy**

"King Cotton" diplomacy failed to secure European support. James Mason and John Slidell represented Confederate interests abroad. Cotton embargo backfired as Europeans found alternative sources.

## Economic and Social Impact

**Wartime Innovation**

Technological advances accelerated by military needs. Railroad construction expanded. Telegraph communication improved. Medical knowledge advanced through battlefield experience.

**Women's Roles**

Women entered nursing profession in large numbers. Clara Barton founded American Red Cross. Dorothea Dix supervised Union hospital nurses. Southern women managed civilian responsibilities.

## War's End and Aftermath

**Surrender at Appomattox**

Lee surrendered to Grant April 9, 1865. Generous terms allowed Confederate soldiers to return home. Other Confederate armies surrendered within weeks.

**Lincoln's Assassination**

John Wilkes Booth killed Lincoln April 14, 1865. Andrew Johnson became president. Radical Republicans gained influence over Reconstruction policy.

**Immediate Consequences**

Union preserved but at enormous cost. 620,000 military deaths. Constitutional amendments ended slavery and extended citizenship. Reconstruction policies remained contentious.

**Long-term Impact**

Federal government power permanently expanded. Industrial economy accelerated. Racial equality remained unfulfilled promise. National identity fundamentally transformed.
